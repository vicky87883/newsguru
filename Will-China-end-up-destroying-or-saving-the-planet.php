<p class="font-large" style="color:red;">The nation's carbon emissions are about to peak. The challenging part then begins.</p>
	<p>EVEN AS HE lay dying from brain cancer, Tu Changwang wanted to say one final thing. The well-known Chinese meteorologist had noted the warming of the temperature. Thus, he issued a warning in 1961 that this would change the conditions necessary for existence in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily. Nonetheless, he believed that the warming was a natural component of a solar activity cycle that would eventually reverse itself. </p>
	<p>Tu was unaware that the use of fossil fuels was contributing to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A picture of happy coalminers appeared in that People's Daily issue, a few pages ahead of his piece. China was racing toward industrialization in an attempt to close the economic gap with the West.</p>
	<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-6958761602872755"
     data-ad-slot="3917672390"></ins>

	<p>Presently, China stands as a global industrial giant, accounting for more than 25% of global manufacturing, surpassing the combined output of Germany and America. However, the advancement has come at an emissions cost. China is the nation that has released the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere overall over the last thirty years (see chart 1). Today, it contributes more than 25% of the global greenhouse gas emissions annually, as reported by the American research firm Rhodium Group. That is roughly twice as much as the United States, which comes in second (but it is still worse per person).</p>
	<p>Therefore, China plays a critical role in keeping global warming since the Industrial Revolution well below 2°C, as pledged by states in 2015 at the UN climate summit in Paris. The COP28 meeting of this year got underway in Dubai on November 30. For those present, China has both good and terrible news.</p>
	<p>Positively, China's emissions will soon come to an end. According to some analysts, they will peak this year. There's little question that the peak will occur before 2030, China's self-imposed deadline. It is outpacing all other nations in the construction of nuclear power plants. It has also made significant investments in renewable energy (see chart 2), to the point where it now has roughly 750 gigawatts of solar and wind power, or one-third of the global total. The government wants to have 1,200GW of such capacity by the end of the decade, which is more than the current total power capacity of the European Union. China is likely to surpass that goal.
</p>
	<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>
	<p>China is reducing emissions, but it is doing so for more reasons than just embracing renewable energy. Its output of cement and steel with high carbon content has been declining. The government is spending less on large-scale infrastructure projects after decades of constructing roads and railroads. A protracted boom in the real estate market culminated in a collapse that rocked the economy but reduced emissions. Few economists predict that China's GDP will expand as quickly as it did at the close of the last century and the start of the current one. Stated differently, it is most likely the result of China's dirtiest stage of development.
</p>
	<p>What comes after, though, is much more significant than the top. By 2060, China aims to achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases, sometimes known as "carbon neutrality." It will be significantly more difficult to hit this target. Much more than half of China's energy still comes from polluting coal, even after that significant infusion of renewable energy. Although it is less than the roughly 70% it was in 2011, China is nevertheless burning more coal due to rising energy consumption. China permitted the construction of about two new coal-fired power plants each week on average last year, and the country mined a record 4.5 billion tonnes of the black rock.
</p>
	<p>Many of these might never come to pass. The argument for additional building is undermined by the declining rates of operation of the current coal plants. However, China is not weaning itself off of coal as quickly as economists or environmentalists believe is required to accomplish its 2060 aim. The fact that it's widespread in the nation contributes to the issue. Coal is a reliable energy source for China because it uses less gas and oil. Its excavation generates work. Whether or not it is necessary, building a coal plant is another popular strategy used by municipal governments to promote economic development.</p>
	<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>
	<p>Coal was considered for building China's electrical grid. Humans determine when to increase or decrease operations at the factories that burn the material. However, nature is in charge when it comes to solar and wind power. Thus, more flexibility needs to be added to the grid. It needs to be able to store or transfer excess energy when it is present in one place. If not, China won't be able to install a large number of new solar panels and wind turbines in the future.
</p>
	<h6 style="color:red;">Gridlock</h6>
	<p>Most nations' grids require comparable modifications. However, according to energy consultant David Fishman of the Lantau Group, China has a distinct difficulty. The western region of the nation contains the majority of its solar and wind resources. However, the largest cities in the nation are located in the east, where there is a greater need for the electricity they produce. It's challenging to transfer it over such vast distances. The fact that province governments have extensive control over how their part of the grid functions is another issue. They dislike having to rely on one another for energy. Thus, a province might, for instance, favor using its own coal plant over a greener energy source that is located somewhere else.
</p>

     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>
	<p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that worries people as much about China's development as it does. Certain nations can reduce their methane emissions through straightforward measures like fixing leaking gas pipelines. However, the majority of methane originating from China escapes from coal mines or is generated by microorganisms in rice paddies. It is difficult to solve the issue without stopping mines or altering farming methods. China therefore declined to join more than 100 other nations—including the United States—who made the commitment to cut methane emissions globally by at least 30% by 2030 at the UN climate summit in 2021. China did, however, state earlier this month that it would address the matter in its national climate plan for 2035 (which might not be released for another two years).</p>
	<p>China's leaders need to be fearless in the face of these difficulties. However, according to Li Shuo, the new director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York, their aspirations over climate change may already have peaked. He thinks the administration has been alarmed recently by power outages brought on by rising coal prices and droughts that interfere with hydropower. Officials are now concerned that climate-friendly measures may jeopardize the nation's energy security (greens contend that certain reforms, including loosening the grid's restrictions, will have the opposite impact). Instead of a reduction, Mr. Li anticipates a plateau in China's emissions.
</p>
	<p>China has emerged as a pioneer in green energy technology in the interim. China produces most of the solar panels and batteries that are used by the rest of the globe. China became the world's largest car exporter this year, surpassing Japan in part because of its supremacy in the electric vehicle market.
</p>
	<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>
	<h6 style="color:red;">Summits and peaks</h6>
	<p>Thus, there is a chance that China will contribute positively to the climate conference in Dubai. It will not want to appear as though it is ignoring a problem that is at the top of the agenda for many authorities in developing nations, especially if it hopes to lead the global south. The November encounter between China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and his American counterpart, John Kerry, is another reason for optimism. They also decided to work together on carbon-capture projects, among other minor measures.
</p>
	<p>China has however stated unequivocally that it will not give in to pressure regarding climate change. Its leader, Xi Jinping, reaffirmed earlier this year his goal of attaining carbon neutrality by 2060 and a peak in carbon emissions by 2030. However, he added, "we should and must determine the path, method, pace, and intensity to achieve this goal, and we will never be influenced by others."</p>
