    <p>The crowd heckled the famed NFL quarterback Tom Brady at the NYC Fanaticsfest panel when he made a joke about local hero Daniel Jones of the New York Giants.
    </p>

    <p>
Fans wore jerseys honoring Brady's tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the New England Patriots, and even his time as a college student at Michigan. As Brady discussed his opinions on criticizing other quarterbacks after hanging up his boots, the mood changed.
</p>
<p>Brady, who was well-known for his ability to be critical of himself while playing, was not afraid to share how he evaluated players' NFL performances.
    </p>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-6958761602872755"
     data-ad-slot="3917672390"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
    <p>
"I had a lot of criticism for my NFL performance. And I have a lot of criticism for the way our team(s) performed in the NFL," he told reporters, notably those from Mirror U.S.
</p>
<p>But when Brady revealed the conundrum he expects to face in his broadcasting post regarding taming his sharp judgments, things really got interesting:
    </p>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-6958761602872755"
     data-ad-slot="3917672390"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
    <p>
The performance standards I held myself to were extremely high. The hardest thing for me to deal with is realizing that something was awful when I saw it. I just can't say that on TV, like," he said frank.
    </p>
    <p>
Tom Brady got into trouble when he talked about integrity in sports commentary. He revealed to moderator Stephen A. Smith that he withholds things because of his family:
</p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-6958761602872755"
     data-ad-slot="3917672390"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>"Well, I don't want to phrase it that way all the time because there are parents and other family members. I would walk to the sidelines after throwing a particularly poor interception and declare, "You are the worst quarterback in the world." How on earth are you going to make that throw? That was quite awful.
</p>
<p>But at the Brady fan-filled gathering, his attempt to highlight his point with Daniel Jones of the New York Giants didn't go as planned. When Brady said, "Let's say Daniel Jones throws an interception," the audience erupted in jeers, demonstrating their unwavering love for New York football despite the team's terrible five-year record under Jones.
    </p>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-6958761602872755"
     data-ad-slot="3917672390"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
    <p>
Jones recorded 12,512 passing yards, 62 touchdowns, and 40 interceptions during his tenure with the Giants. As a result, he finished his career with an 85.2 career passer rating. Jones had an ACL injury during a game against the Las Vegas Raiders in the eighth week of the previous campaign, and is presently recovering.
</p>
<p>He sat out the Giants' first preseason clash with the Detroit Lions, but head coach Brian Daboll hinted that their star player is set to hit the turf in the last preseason match against the Houston Texans. The franchise's faith in Jones was also broadcast on TV during their offseason special "Hard Knocks," where General Manager Joe Schoen opted to stick with the QB over two-time Pro Bowl running back Saquon Barkley.</p>
