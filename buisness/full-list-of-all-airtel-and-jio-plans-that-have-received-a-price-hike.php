Popular package Rs 249 (up from Rs 209) offers unlimited calls and SMS for the same period of time, along with 1 GB of internet every day.
    </p>
    <p>In the meantime, 1.5 GB of data per day and comparable call and SMS advantages are now included in the Rs 299 package, which was previously available for Rs 239. Price increases have also affected the Rs 349 and Rs 399 plans, which now offer daily data allotment of 2 GB and 2.5 GB and cost Rs 349 and Rs 399, respectively.
